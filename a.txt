web_socket_channel: For WebSocket connections to the backend.
Implementation Notes
Chat Screen: Connect to the backend’s WebSocket endpoint (/chat) using web_socket_channel. Display incoming messages in real time and save them to SQLite.
Journaling: Use a TextEditingController for text input; save entries to SQLite with a timestamp.
Mood Board: Query SQLite for mood logs, pass data to FlLineChart for rendering.
Payments: Call Lemon Squeezy’s checkout URL when the user taps “Subscribe”; verify license keys via backend API.
Scalability Notes
Lazy Loading: Load chat messages and journal entries in chunks (e.g., 20 at a time) to save memory.
Offline Mode: Ensure all features work without internet; sync summaries to the cloud when online.
CDN: Serve static assets (e.g., icons, images) via a CDN like Cloudflare for faster load times.
Backend (Node.js with Fastify)
The backend uses Node.js with Fastify, a lightweight and fast framework perfect for real-time apps like Kounsel Me.
Key Components
Real-Time Chat:
Handled by uWebSockets.js, integrated into Fastify for WebSocket support.
Manages live messaging between the Flutter app and AI.
API Endpoints:
GET /chat: WebSocket endpoint for real-time messaging.
POST /summary: Triggers summarization of chat sessions (calls T5 on Lambda).
POST /license: Verifies Lemon Squeezy license keys for premium access.
Database Connections:
Neon Serverless PostgreSQL: Stores user metadata, summaries, and subscription status.
Redis: Caches active chat sessions and frequently accessed data.
AI Integration:
Makes API calls to OpenAI for chat responses and Whisper for voice transcription.
Triggers T5 on AWS Lambda for summarization and mood analysis.
Dependencies
fastify: Core framework for routing and server setup.
uwebsockets.js: High-performance WebSocket library for real-time chat.
@neondatabase/serverless: Driver for Neon PostgreSQL connectivity.
ioredis: Redis client for caching.
axios: For making HTTP requests to OpenAI and Lemon Squeezy APIs.
Sample Code (Basic Fastify Setup)
javascript
const fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true });
const uWS = require('uWebSockets.js');

fastify.get('/chat', { websocket: true }, (connection, req) => {
  connection.socket.on('message', (message) => {
    // Handle incoming messages, send to AI, broadcast response
    connection.socket.send('AI response here');
  });
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
Scalability Notes
Stateless Design: Keep Fastify servers stateless; store session data in Redis.
Load Balancing: Use AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
Containerization: Package the app in Docker and deploy with AWS ECS Fargate for easy scaling.
Database (Neon and SQLite)
Kounsel Me uses a hybrid database approach for privacy and scalability:
SQLite (Local): Stores full chat histories, journals, and mood data on the user’s device.
Neon Serverless PostgreSQL (Cloud): Stores lightweight metadata, summaries, and subscription info.
Key Tables (Neon PostgreSQL)
users:
id (UUID): Unique user identifier.
license_key (string): Lemon Squeezy license key.
is_premium (boolean): Subscription status.
created_at (timestamp): User signup date.
chat_summaries:
user_id (UUID): Foreign key to users.
session_id (UUID): Unique chat session ID.
summary (text): AI-generated summary.
timestamp (timestamp): When summary was created.
mood_metadata:
user_id (UUID): Foreign key to users.
mood_trend (json): Aggregated mood data (e.g., { "happy": 5, "sad": 2 }).
last_updated (timestamp): Last update time.
SQLite Schema (Local)
chats: id, session_id, message, is_user, timestamp.
journals: id, content, timestamp.
moods: id, mood_type, intensity, timestamp.
Scalability Notes
Neon: Automatically scales compute with demand; add read replicas for high read traffic.
SQLite: Scales with the number of users (device-side); syncs only summaries/metadata to Neon.
Indexing: Add indexes on users.id and chat_summaries.user_id for fast queries.
Real-Time Chat (uWebSockets.js)
Real-time communication is powered by uWebSockets.js, a fast and lightweight WebSocket library.
Implementation
WebSocket Endpoint (/chat):
Flutter app connects using web_socket_channel.
Messages are sent to the AI (OpenAI) and responses are broadcast back to the client.
Multi-User Sync:
Use Redis Pub/Sub to sync messages across multiple server instances if scaling horizontally.
Context Management:
Store the last 5-10 messages in Redis (sliding window) for AI context.
Summarize chats every 10 messages with T5 (via Lambda) and save to Neon.
Sample Code (uWebSockets.js Integration)
javascript
const uWS = require('uWebSockets.js');

const app = uWS.App().ws('/chat', {
  open: (ws) => console.log('Client connected'),
  message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {
    const text = Buffer.from(message).toString();
    // Send to OpenAI, get response
    ws.send('AI: ' + text); // Placeholder response
  },
  close: (ws) => console.log('Client disconnected'),
}).listen(3000, (token) => {
  if (token) console.log('WebSocket server on port 3000');
});
Scalability Notes
Horizontal Scaling: Add more Fastify instances; Redis syncs WebSocket state.
Connection Capacity: uWebSockets.js can handle 100,000+ connections per server.
AI Integration (OpenAI and T5)
AI powers the core features of Kounsel Me:
OpenAI:
ChatGPT: Provides real-time chat responses for mediation and support.
Whisper: Transcribes voice inputs for chat and journaling.
T5 (Hugging Face):
Self-hosted on AWS Lambda for summarization and mood analysis.
Runs periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes or after 10 messages).
Implementation
Real-Time Chat:
Send user messages to OpenAI’s API via Fastify.
Cache common responses in Redis to reduce API calls and costs.
Voice Transcription:
Upload audio files to Lambda, process with Whisper, return transcribed text.
Summarization:
Trigger T5 on Lambda to summarize chat sessions; store results in Neon.
Mood Analysis:
Analyze journal entries with T5 to detect emotions (e.g., happy, sad); save trends locally and sync metadata to Neon.
Sample Code (OpenAI Call)
javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function getChatResponse(message) {
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: message }],
  }, { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}` } });
  return response.data.choices[0].message.content;
}
Scalability Notes
Serverless: Lambda scales automatically with usage.
Cost Control: Use T5 for non-real-time tasks to minimize OpenAI costs.
Batching: Process summaries in batches (e.g., multiple sessions at once) to optimize Lambda usage.
Payments and Licensing (Lemon Squeezy)
Lemon Squeezy manages payments and licenses for Kounsel Me’s freemium model:
Free Tier: 50 chat messages/month, basic journaling, no voice.
Paid Tier ($5/month): Unlimited chat, voice, and advanced mood insights.
Implementation
Frontend:
Add a “Subscribe” button in Flutter that opens Lemon Squeezy’s checkout URL.
Check license status via backend API (/license) to unlock features.
Backend:
Use Lemon Squeezy’s API to generate license keys after payment.
Verify keys with a /license endpoint before granting premium access.
Database:
Store license_key and is_premium in Neon’s users table.
Sample Code (License Verification)
javascript
fastify.post('/license', async (req, reply) => {
  const { license_key } = req.body;
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1/licenses/validate', { license_key });
  if (response.data.valid) {
    // Update user in Neon as premium
    return { status: 'valid' };
  }
  return { status: 'invalid' };
});
Scalability Notes
Lemon Squeezy: Built on Stripe’s infrastructure, scales to millions of transactions.
License Checks: Fastify and Neon handle verification with low latency.
Scalability and Performance
To ensure Kounsel Me scales to millions of users:
Local-First: Store most data in SQLite on-device, reducing server load.
Stateless Backend: Fastify instances scale horizontally with ECS Fargate.
Database: Neon auto-scales compute; Redis caches hot data for quick access.
Serverless AI: T5 on Lambda scales with demand, no fixed servers needed.
CDN: Use Cloudflare to serve static assets globally with low latency.
Security and Privacy
Encryption: Use AES-256 to encrypt SQLite data and backups on-device.
API Security: Enforce HTTPS for all communications; use JWT for user authentication.
Data Minimization: Sync only summaries and metadata to Neon, keeping full data local.
Compliance: Lemon Squeezy handles global tax and compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
