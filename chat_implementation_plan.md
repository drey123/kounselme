- Implement connection status handling and reconnection logic
- Add message queuing for offline scenarios

### Task 2.2: Implement API Integration
- Create service classes for API calls
- Implement session management API calls
- Add message history retrieval functionality

### Task 2.3: Simplify Authentication
