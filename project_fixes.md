# KounselMe Project Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. WebSocket Service Implementation Issues

- **Multiple WebSocket Service Implementations**: There are several implementations of WebSocket services in different locations:
  - `lib/data/services/websocket_service.dart` (abstract interface)
  - `lib/data/services/real_websocket_service.dart` (concrete implementation)
  - `lib/data/mock/mock_websocket_service.dart` (mock implementation)
  - `lib/data/remote/websocket_service.dart` (another implementation)
  - `lib/data/remote/database_service.dart` (contains duplicate WebSocket code)

- **Inconsistent Service Factory Usage**: The `ServiceFactory` class is designed to switch between mock and real implementations, but it's not consistently used throughout the codebase.

- **Incomplete Real WebSocket Implementation**: The `RealWebSocketService` implementation is incomplete and uses a hardcoded URL.

### 2. Environment Configuration Issues

- **Inconsistent Environment Usage**: The environment configuration is not consistently applied across the codebase.

- **Placeholder API Keys**: The environment files contain placeholder API keys that need to be properly managed.

### 3. UI and Styling Issues

- **Hardcoded Colors**: Several components use hardcoded colors instead of the theme system.

- **Inconsistent Styling**: Some components use different styling approaches.

### 4. Backend Integration Issues

- **Mock vs. Real Services**: The codebase is using mock services in some places and attempting to use real services in others.

- **Incomplete Error Handling**: Error handling is limited throughout the application.

## Fix Plan

### 1. Consolidate WebSocket Services

1. **Standardize WebSocket Interface**:
   - Keep the abstract interface in `lib/data/services/websocket_service.dart`
   - Ensure all implementations follow this interface

2. **Clean Up Implementations**:
   - Consolidate the real implementation in `lib/data/services/real_websocket_service.dart`
   - Keep the mock implementation in `lib/data/mock/mock_websocket_service.dart`
   - Remove duplicate code from `lib/data/remote/database_service.dart`

3. **Consistent Service Factory Usage**:
   - Update `ServiceFactory` to properly create the appropriate service based on environment
   - Ensure all code uses `ServiceFactory` to get service instances

### 2. Fix Environment Configuration

1. **Standardize Environment Usage**:
   - Ensure all code uses `Env` class for configuration
   - Update `Env` class to properly load values from environment files

2. **Secure API Keys**:
   - Implement proper API key management
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information

### 3. Improve UI and Styling

1. **Use Theme System Consistently**:
   - Replace hardcoded colors with theme values
   - Ensure consistent styling across components

2. **Enhance Responsive Design**:
   - Improve responsive design for all components
   - Ensure proper adaptation to different screen sizes

### 4. Complete Backend Integration

1. **Implement Real Backend Connection**:
   - Complete the real WebSocket service implementation
   - Implement proper error handling and reconnection logic

2. **Enhance Session Management**:
   - Improve time tracking and session control features
   - Implement proper multi-user session management

## Implementation Priority

1. **Consolidate WebSocket Services** - This is the most critical issue causing confusion in the codebase
2. **Fix Environment Configuration** - Needed for proper backend connection
3. **Complete Backend Integration** - Essential for app functionality
4. **Improve UI and Styling** - Important for user experience but can be addressed after core functionality

## Next Steps

1. Create a consolidated WebSocket service implementation
2. Update the service factory to use the consolidated implementation
3. Fix the environment configuration to properly support development and production environments
4. Implement proper error handling throughout the application
